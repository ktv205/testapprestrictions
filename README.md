# testapprestrictions
This is an test app to test the and implement the app restrictions in your app that you defined in your xml 
and exposed to the EMMs

EMMs can pull the restriction info from your app xml and change those values
You have to listen to those changes to apply the changes your self in your app

Go through http://developer.android.com/training/enterprise/app-restrictions.html documentation
and two sample apps 
http://developer.android.com/samples/AppRestrictionSchema/index.html 
http://developer.android.com/samples/AppRestrictionEnforcer/index.html

To test this app you need to install TestDPC app from play store and set the restrictions there on this app
to see the changes in the restriction values in the app.
